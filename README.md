## The project is built on top of the open-source project Reactfolio by Tharindu N. Madhusanka, with UI/UX inspiration coming from Hisham Salameh and Apple's simplistically sophisticated design philosophy;)

## It has been an enriching learning journey, providing both valuable insights and a refreshing experience on UI/UX principles. I am very eager to explore the application of Front-End Development in Cloud Computing and to investigate its potential applications in crafting user-centered designs in the realms of AI and ML.

## Please feel free to reach me out if you have any questions.
